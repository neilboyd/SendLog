# SendLog

[SendLog](http://l6n.org/android/sendlog.shtml)
was originally released as an app to
[Google Play](http://l6n.org/android/sendlog.shtml).  
Due to
[changes in READ_LOGS permission in Android 4.1](http://groups.google.com/d/msg/android-developers/6U4A5irWang/dEsqi0dyPkkJ),
the app became a bit useless.
TL;DR: an app can only read it's own logs.  
That is why I decided to open source it so that you can include it in your own app.

## Brief Instructions
 - Add a dependency to sendlog-library
 - Extend `SendLogActivityBase` and implement one method
 - Add your activity to the manifest with translucent theme
 - Start the activity at a suitable point in your app

## Detailed Instructions

### Example
There is a sample project `sendlog-userapp` which demonstrates all the steps
described below.

### Add a dependency to sendlog-library
If you're using Maven you can simply add this dependency
```
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.l6n</groupId>
   <artifactId>sendlog-library</artifactId>
   <version>2.0</version>
   <type>aar</type>
</dependency>
```
Otherwise you can just download the source and reference it.

### Extend `SendLogActivityBase` and implement one method
Create an activity called `SendLogActivity` in your project which extends
`org.l6n.sendlog.library.SendLogActivityBase`.

Implement the following method  
`@Override protected String getDestinationAddress() { return "android@L6n.org"; }`.  
Obviously you should use your own email address instead of mine for users to send their logs to.

### Add your activity to the manifest with translucent theme
In your manifest, add the activity created above  
`<activity android:name=".SendLogActivity" android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar"/>`

### Start the activity at a suitable point in your app
Somewhere in your app you'll want to allow users to send the log,
for example in a Help or About menu.  
`startActivity(new Intent(this, SendLogActivity.class));`

That's it!
